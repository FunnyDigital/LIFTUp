# Personalization Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully replaced placeholder data throughout the app with dynamic, personalized content based on user onboarding data.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Workout Generation Service (`src/services/workoutGenerationService.ts`)
- **Personalized workout recommendations** based on:
  - Fitness goals (lose belly fat, build muscle, lean mass, cardio, strength, maintenance)
  - Activity level (sedentary to very active)
  - Workout days per week (2-7 days)
  - Equipment access (home, basic gym, full gym)

- **Smart workout selection**:
  - 4-day split routines for muscle building (4+ days/week)
  - Full-body workouts for 2-3 days/week
  - Nigerian-themed workouts (Lagos Streets HIIT, Afrobeats Cardio, etc.)
  - Difficulty scaling based on activity level

- **Personalized calculations**:
  - Estimated time to reach fitness goal
  - Daily calorie targets using Mifflin-St Jeor equation
  - Adjustments based on activity level and goals

### 2. Home Screen Personalization (`src/screens/main/HomeScreen.tsx`)
**Before**: Hard-coded placeholder data
- Name: "Oluwaseun"
- Workout: "Push Day - Chest & Triceps"
- Stats: Fixed values

**After**: Dynamic user data
- Real user name from profile or email
- Dynamic greeting based on time of day
- Today's workout based on user's fitness goal and day rotation
- Prompt to complete profile if data missing

### 3. Workouts Screen Personalization (`src/screens/main/WorkoutsScreen.tsx`)
**Before**: Generic workout list from Firestore only

**After**: Personalized workout recommendations
- New "Recommended" category showing workouts tailored to user's goal
- Subtitle shows user's fitness goal
- Fallback to personalized workouts if Firestore is empty
- Workouts match user's equipment level and experience

### 4. Onboarding Data Collection
**Created**: `src/store/slices/onboardingSlice.ts`
- Centralized Redux slice for collecting onboarding data
- Stores all 7 screens of user information

**Updated all onboarding screens** to save data to Redux:
- **PersonalInfoScreen**: First name, last name, age, sex
- **BodyMetricsScreen**: Height, weight (with metric/imperial conversion)
- **FitnessGoalsScreen**: Selected fitness goal
- **ActivityLevelScreen**: Activity level
- **WorkoutPreferencesScreen**: Workout days/week, equipment, location

### 5. Onboarding Summary Screen (`src/screens/onboarding/OnboardingSummaryScreen.tsx`)
**Before**: Mock data display only

**After**: Complete profile management
- Displays actual collected data from all onboarding screens
- Calculates personalized time-to-goal estimates
- Calculates daily calorie targets
- Saves complete UserProfile to Redux
- Saves profile to Firestore for persistence
- Clears temporary onboarding data after completion

## Technical Improvements

### Type Safety
- All date fields changed from `Date` to `string` (ISO format) for Redux serializability
- Fixed Firestore Timestamp conversion to ISO strings
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout

### Data Flow
1. User completes onboarding ‚Üí Data saved to `onboardingSlice`
2. On completion ‚Üí Data compiled into `UserProfile`
3. Profile saved to both:
   - Redux `userSlice` (for instant access)
   - Firestore (for persistence)
4. Onboarding data cleared from temporary slice

### Firestore Integration
- Fixed "undefined field" error by ensuring all fields have default values
- Proper timestamp handling (Firestore Timestamp ‚Üí ISO string)
- Error handling with fallback to generated workouts

## User Experience Enhancements

### Personalization Examples

**For a user who wants to "Build Muscle" with "Full Gym" access:**
- Home screen shows: "Chest & Triceps Power üí™" (60 min workout)
- Workouts screen "Recommended" tab shows:
  - Chest & Triceps Power
  - Back & Biceps Mass Builder
  - Leg Day - Nigerian Strength
  - Shoulders & Arms Sculptor
- Summary shows: "Estimated time: 16 weeks"

**For a user who wants to "Lose Belly Fat" with "Home" equipment:**
- Home screen shows: "Lagos Streets HIIT üèÉ" (20-40 min based on level)
- Workouts screen shows:
  - Lagos Streets HIIT
  - Afrobeats Cardio Dance
  - Full Body Fat Burn
- Summary shows: "Estimated time: 12 weeks"

### Nigerian Context Maintained
- All workouts include Nigerian cultural references
- Lagos-themed exercises (Lagos Streets HIIT)
- Nigerian music integration (Afrobeats Cardio)
- Local equipment context (VI/GRA gyms, neighborhood gyms, home setups)
