# Profile Data Placeholder Fix

## Issue
Profile and other screens were showing placeholder/mock data instead of actual user information collected during onboarding.

## Files Fixed

### 1. ProfileScreen (`src/screens/main/ProfileScreen.tsx`)
**Before:**
- Used hard-coded mock data for all user information
- Showed "Oluwaseun Adebayo" as name
- Displayed fake email, phone, subscription data

**After:**
- Pulls real user data from Redux store (`state.auth.user` and `state.user.profile`)
- Displays actual user name from profile (firstName + lastName)
- Shows real email from Firebase Auth
- Displays real phone number (or "Not set" if empty)
- Shows actual location, join date, fitness goals from onboarding
- Displays real subscription status and plan details
- Shows actual height, weight, workout days from user profile
- Properly formats activity level and fitness goals for display

### 2. ProgressScreen (`src/screens/main/ProgressScreen.tsx`)
**Before:**
- Used hard-coded weight values (70.5 kg, 73.0 kg start, 68.0 kg target)
- Showed fake workout completion stats

**After:**
- Pulls current weight from user profile
- Calculates planned workouts based on user's workoutDaysPerWeek setting
- Shows user's actual fitness data
- Added TODO comments for future enhancements (initial weight tracking, target weight, completed workouts tracking)

### 3. CalendarScreen (`src/screens/main/CalendarScreen.tsx`)
**Before:**
- Showed generic "Push Day - Chest & Triceps" workout

**After:**
- Generates today's workout using `workoutGenerationService.getTodaysWorkout()`
- Shows personalized workout name and duration based on user's fitness goal
- Displays workout schedule tailored to user's preferences
- Shows prompt to complete profile if no user data available

## Data Flow

### User Profile Data Structure
```typescript
UserProfile {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
  sex: 'male' | 'female'
  height: number (cm)
  weight: number (kg)
  activityLevel: 'sedentary' | 'light' | 'moderate' | 'active' | 'very_active'
  fitnessGoal: FitnessGoal
  location: string
  workoutDaysPerWeek: number
  preferredUnits: 'metric' | 'imperial'
}
```

### Redux State Access
All screens now use:
```typescript
const user = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.auth.user);
const userProfile = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.user.profile);
```

## Display Formatting Functions

Added helper functions to format data for display:

1. **formatActivityLevel**: Converts `very_active` → "Very Active"
2. **formatFitnessGoal**: Converts `build_muscle` → "Build Muscle"
3. **formatEquipment**: Converts `full_gym` → "Full Gym"
4. **formatDate**: Converts ISO date strings to readable format (e.g., "January 2024")

## Fallback Handling

All screens now handle missing data gracefully:
- Shows "Not set" for empty fields
- Falls back to email username if name not available
- Shows 0 or default values for numeric fields
- Displays prompts to complete profile when data is missing

## What Users Will See

### After Completing Onboarding:
**Profile Screen:**
- Their actual name (e.g., "John Doe")
- Their real email address
- Their phone number (if provided)
- Their selected location (e.g., "Lagos, Nigeria")
- Join date based on account creation
- Their chosen fitness goal (e.g., "Build Muscle")
- Their selected activity level (e.g., "Moderately Active")
- Their actual height and weight
- Their workout frequency (e.g., "4 days")

**Home Screen:**
- Personalized greeting with their first name
- Today's workout based on their fitness goal
- Workout duration matching their experience level

**Workouts Screen:**
- "Recommended" tab with workouts for their specific goal
- Equipment-appropriate exercises
- Difficulty matching their activity level

**Calendar Screen:**
- Today's personalized workout
- Scheduled workouts matching their plan

**Progress Screen:**
- Their actual weight data
- Workout goals based on their workout frequency
- Stats personalized to their profile

### Before Completing Profile:
- Generic messages prompting to complete profile
- Fallback to email username for personalization
- Default "Not set" values displayed

## Testing Checklist

To verify the fix works:
1. [x] Sign in with an existing account that completed onboarding
2. [x] Navigate to Profile screen - verify real data shows
3. [x] Check Home screen - verify personalized greeting
4. [x] Check Workouts screen - verify recommended workouts
5. [x] Check Calendar screen - verify today's workout
6. [x] Check Progress screen - verify weight/stats data
7. [ ] Create a new account without completing onboarding
8. [ ] Verify fallback messages show properly

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Add "Edit Profile" functionality to update user data
- [ ] Store initial weight for accurate progress tracking
- [ ] Add target weight field to profile
- [ ] Track completed workouts for accurate stats

### Medium Term
- [ ] Add profile photo upload
- [ ] Implement progress photo tracking
- [ ] Add workout history
- [ ] Add weight tracking over time (chart)
- [ ] Sync subscription status from Paystack

### Long Term
- [ ] Social features (share progress)
- [ ] Achievement system
- [ ] Personal records tracking
- [ ] Custom workout creation

## Notes

- All date fields are stored as ISO strings for Redux serialization
- Firestore Timestamps are converted to ISO strings when reading
- Phone number defaults to empty string to avoid undefined errors
- Equipment type is inferred from fitness goal (can be enhanced later)
- Subscription data comes from Firebase Auth user object
